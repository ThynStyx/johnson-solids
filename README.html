		A collection of the <a href="./?ready=1">Johnson Solids</a> using <a href="https://vzome.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vZome</a> technology
	</h1>    
	<h2>
		Guidelines for contributing vZome models
	</h2> 
	<p>
		Contributers must have a github account and a "vzome-sharing" repo confugured for 
		<a href="https://docs.vzome.com/sharing.html"" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharing vZome Designs</a>.
		After posting a compliant model to their own "vzome-sharing" repo, notify the rest of the vZome community on 
		<a href="https://discord.com/channels/808488427400986724/1176604061294936114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a>,
		and one of the moderators there will integrate your shared model into this collection of Johnson Solids
		by adding a reference to the posted model in-situ rather than by copying it into the "johnson-solids" repo.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alternatively, experienced Git users may fork the "johnson-solids" <a href="https://github.com/vZome/johnson-solids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repo</a>
		directly and submit Pull Requests (PR's) directly from branches in their own fork.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a general rule, all vZome files should:
		<ol>
			<li>Use the simplest (lowest order) algebraic field in which the model can be generated.</li>
			<li>Have an edge length equal to the default blue or green strut in the applicable field and symmetry system. (e.g. B1 or G1)
				The Root2 field is an exception. In the Root2 field, octahedral symmetry should be used 
				and the strut length should equal "long blue" which also equals "long green".
			</li>
			<li>Retain the default vZome background color.</li>
			<li>Either have the default scene contain only panels forming the Johnson solid 
				or else capture a scene containing only panels forming the Johnson solid. Name the scene "Faces".
			</li>
			<li>Have the centroid or significant symmetry features (points, lines or planes) located at the origin and consistently oriented and aligned with X, Y and Z axes.
				An exception is when one solid is constructed by adjoining two others. In this case, a single file may be used to show all of them, 
				and featuring that relationship by having just one of them centered around the origin. TODO: List examples here.
			</li>
			<li>Include the name(s) of the Johnson solid(s) in the file name. (e.g. J1 ... J92)</li>
			<li>Include a corresponding .shapes.json file. This happens automatically when the model is published to a vzome-sharing repo directly from vZome desktop.</li>
		</ol>
		<a href="https://www.zometool.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zometool</a> constructible models should comply with these additional guidelines:
		<ol>
			<li>Use the golden field</li>
			<li>Use icosahedral symmetry with lifelike shapes for the default scene.</li>
			<li>Capture a scene containing only balls and struts forming the edges of the Johnson solid. Name the scene "Edges".
				This criteria is optional for non-zometool constructible models, but still recommended.</li>
			<li>Note that "lifelike shapes" must be visible in the main model at the time the "Edges" scene is captured, not just when saving the finished model.</li>
			<li>Retain the default strut and panel colors to correspond with the color criteria below.</li>
			<li>If the model can be built from real zometool struts, then use an orientation that shows how it can be accomplished.</li>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li>Contributers who are using the "vZome Sharing" workflow do NOT need to post anything to the johnson-solids repo. Just notify us on Discord that you have a model for consideration.</li>
			<li>Contributers who are using the PR workflow should note that field names, file names and scene names are all case sensitive in johnson-solids-models.js 
				and that appropriate values are required for the field, edgescene, facescene, zometool and url attributes in johnson-solids-models.js 
				in order to incorporate any models into the collection. (See existing examples)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		A single vZome file may contain multiple scenes, each showing different Johnson solid (panels-only). 
		In this case, each scene must have a unique name, typically including the name of the solid. (e.g. J38 Faces)
		If the model uses the golden field, each panels-only scene should have a corresponding comparably named edges-only scene for each solid. (e.g. J38 Edges)
		See J38 and J39 as an example.
		In any case, each scene must have a unique name. No scene should be named "default scene" since that is reserved for the main model.
	</p>
	<h3>Colors</h3> 
	<p>
		All struts should retain their default vZome colors since they are only shown when the models are zometool constructible
		in which case, they will thereby match the actual zometool strut colors.<br>
		Panels should use a common coloring scheme for all models, based on the default vZome strut colors in icosahedral symmetry.<br>
		The following colors should be used for the corresponding types of faces regardless of the field in which it is built.
		<table>
			<tr><td> Triangles </td><td> Yellow </td><td> rgb( 247, 207, 127 ) </td></tr>
			<tr><td> Squares   </td><td> Blue   </td><td> rgb( 127, 186, 202 ) </td></tr>
			<tr><td> Pentagons </td><td> Red    </td><td> rgb( 215, 127, 127 ) </td></tr>
